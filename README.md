# Ultropia

Before you run any of the three applications, they must be initalized. Go into the 
project directory you want to run (eg, /ultropiaultrasonics.com) and type "npm init" 
to download the required dependencies. After the instalation finishes, you can run
the project. 

To run the app, go into the directory of the site you want to run (eg, /ultropiaultrasonics.com) 
and run "npm start" in the console. This will open up the app in your browser. 

The form functionality for ultropiaultrasonics.com does not work without running the 
app in the /express folder. This is run the same way as the other projects. and also
must have its dependencies install before it is ran.
